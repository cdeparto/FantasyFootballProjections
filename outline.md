# IA626_FinalProject Outline

### Summary: Fantasy Football Projections

The purpose of this project is around fantasy football analytics and the projection of players. There are multiple popular sources that provide projections (such as yahoo and espn) with slight variations between them. The goal is to web scrape the data into csv files from these sites and find an overall average between all of them. The hypothesis to be tested is that by doing this, the player projects will be the most accurate to use when making decisions while playing fantasy football. With the centralized data, a user can use a simple Flask web app in order to search for players and see the top projections for each position on a week by week basis.
